<div class="main">
    <h1>WebHorizon.org: Coming soon</h1>

    <p>Get notified when new web browsers &amp; and major/minor development versions of browsers are released.</p>

    <h3>What this service will be for...</h3>

    <p>Testing browser features before they are released is important to anyone developing sofisticated web applications that use newer frameworks and newer features. This might include: GPS, push notifications, mobile device integrations such as cameras, and offline functionalities.</p>

    <p>Because so many of these features are new, they can evolve quickly and browser makers often make decisions that affect existing implementations. For example, in 2016, Google Chrome began to force SSL upon websites requesting GPS usage, breaking many web applications. They warned about this coming long in advance, but there's no great way to warn developers in advance outside of making blog and email listserv announcements and hoping everyone finds out.</p>

    <p>Right now there are no services to sign up for to find out when new browser versions are pushed out to developers for testing -- certainly none that cover all popular browsers at once. This service aims to fill that gap.</p>

    <p>Until this is set up for sign-ups, you can contact me at {{email}} for more information.</p>
